A review of every resource I used to learn German from A1 to C2.
[Resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/?f=flair_name%3A%22Resource%22)
I started learning German in 2019, passed a B2 exam in 2020 and passed the C2 exam in 2024. I'm off work with an injury so I had the time to write a brief overview of everything I used to get there (disclaimer: I've been living in Germany since 2020).

A1 - B1
Routledge Intensive German Course 1/5
This textbook is designed for use with a teacher and straight up won’t teach a self-learner what they need to know. Frustrating and I eventually just gave up with it.

Assimil German by Maria Roemer 4/5
I loved this book. Each unit drip feeds you new words and structures with funny dialogues and lessons. I like how small and easily digestible they are. The voice acting isn’t very “natural” and not like German you’d hear on the street but it’s clear and expressive. 

I’m also not convinced of the Assimil “method”. The phonetic transcriptions are mostly just annoying and not really needed in an already busy book.. The last 10 chapters also cram in grammar concepts to reach that “B2” level.

Otherwise, a great resource for self learners with high quality dialogues.

Klett Graded Readers 5/5
I found a graded reader ‘pack’ online and worked through a series based in different cities in Germany with short stories. I worked through the stories and would listen to the audio in the shower. 

In total I worked through 8 Graded Readers, I also bought some of Andre Klein’s, which are very good. 

Underrated and a must alongside textbooks, these will help you to get familiar with the language.

Nicos Weg 4.5/5
A high-production series from Deutsche Welle. The German in it is very natural and gets away from ‘textbook’ language. The story becomes a bit bizarre which is entertaining. Each chapter is small and easy to watch, the entire series is also on Youtube. 

The exercises are hit-or-miss and the series is geared towards integration. I like this, for example, when they explain the political system in German. The episodes and exercises on how to apply for an Ausbildung and navigating bureaucracy in Germany can probably be skipped. 

A real gem.

Duolingo 2/5
Useful for whipping out on the bus or in cafes. I find it irritating - imo typing out sentences is laborious, the useless animations just waste my time and the repetition is mind-numbingly dull. I skipped to the end of the German tree.

Some find the streaks motivating. YMMV.

Learn German with Anja 5/5
Entertaining German learning videos for beginners with a personable teacher.

B1 - B2
Practice Makes Perfect Series 3.5/5
A series of exercise books - skip the easy stuff, do the parts you have difficulty with. I liked the sentence builder best and got it for £1.50 on eBay.

Your Daily German 5/5
A blog written by Emmanuel. SO MUCH vocab that is not mentioned elsewhere I got from this website. SO MANY useful articles clearing up confusing or ambiguous words for learners. 

A lot of his articles do a deep dive on verbs and how they combine with prepositions to change their meaning. Unlike videos you can pick and choose which parts you want to focus on. I paid for this website and it was 100% worth it. It’s also filled with humor and personality.

My only critiques: some may not vibe with his strange grammar explanations. I got them and liked them but they’re a bit unconventional. Some of the deep dives mentioned contain word uses which will almost never come up and as a learner it can be difficult to determine what’s useful and what’s not.

Grammatik Aktiv B2-C1 5/5
An exercise book with a mostly double-sided layout. One side explains a grammar concept and the other side contains exercises. Incredibly clear explanations with illustrations and useful exercises. 

I went through this book in ‘passes’. I flicked through it to get familiar. I ticked off the easy chapters and kept coming back, doing a few of the difficult exercises at a time. Spacing it out helped me remember it. There's also a A1 - B1 version.

Easy German 5/5
The GOAT. Amazing street interviews which are really interesting. Great complementary website and an interesting podcast. I love Janusz’s philosophical questions and Cari’s attitude. 

They have high quality resources for all levels. My gf recommended their podcast episode on wills - the trio has a spread of personalities that make the discussions really diverse and interesting. They don’t shy away from ‘deep’ topics either.

Native Content for the B1/2 level
I had read around 8 novels by the time I took my B2 exam. I would underline unknown words with a pencil as well as mark confusing sentences. The idea was to not interrupt my reading flow but be able to go back and fill in the gaps in my knowledge later. Spoiler: I almost never did that.

I listened to ‘Was Jetzt?’ every day and also ‘Woher wissen Sie das?’. I would always get a bit lost during ‘Was Jetzt?’ so I began replaying and writing down any sentences I didn’t understand as part of my study routine.

Aspekte Neu B2 3/5
This is what the VHS uses to teach German. Like Routledge it’s designed for use with a teacher but if you know some German it can be useful to fill in the gaps for a B2 exam. I worked through it when I took the VHS B2 Prüfungsvorbereitungskurs.

Anki deck: 4000 German Words by Frequency 3/5
A frequency deck of many common words. This helped me when I was first reading Harry Potter. I recommend using it only when you know around 60% of the words already. It also requires a lot of work, many German words have multiple definitions on the other side - I would just use one definition or split up the useful ones into separate cards with example sentences.

C1 - C2
Aspekte Neu C1 3/5
Another textbook from the VHS. I was in lockdown when I worked through it, maybe I wouldn’t have bothered otherwise. It’s fine.

C-Grammatik 3/5
A great reference but incredibly dull. Some parts are useful like the Verb + Preposition pairings or the list of verbs that use genitive. Useful maybe for an exam but reading more will be more helpful than rote learning with this book.

Native Content for C1/2
In lockdown I went through the Känguru Chroniken until I understood everything then would listen to it while replaying Hollow Knight. Really funny with incredible replay value and Germans love it when you can quote it. (I went out with an actress who could recite the opening scene verbatim!). Geo Epoche is also good for C2, especially if you like history.

Endstation C2 + Mit Erfolg zum Goethe C2 3/5
Endstation C2 is used by the VHS for the C2 Prüfungsvorbereitungskurs. Each chapter gets a bit more difficult. It’s a bit easier than the exam or ‘Mit Erfolg’. A few of my classmates got a bit blindsided by the difficulty of the exam (they all passed though :D ). Both contain strategy tips for the exam.

I hope someone finds this useful. It might look overwhelming but once you have a solid study routine going you will tear through resources over a few years. I used mostly pomodoro and would give 25 minutes to each resource to keep things fresh.
